# ⚡ FASTEST SETUP - Just Copy & Paste!

## The Error You Got:
`#1054 - Unknown column 'question_id' in 'field list'`

**Why?** The tables weren't created properly.

**Solution:** Use the **COMPLETE_SETUP.sql** file I just created!

---

## 🚀 3-Step Setup (3 minutes)

### Step 1: Start MySQL
Open XAMPP → Click "Start" on MySQL

### Step 2: Run ONE SQL File
1. Go to: **http://localhost/phpmyadmin**
2. Click **"SQL"** tab at the top
3. Open the file: **`sql/COMPLETE_SETUP.sql`**
4. Copy EVERYTHING from that file (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C)
5. Paste into phpMyAdmin SQL box (Ctrl+V)
6. Click **"Go"** button

✅ **Done!** This ONE file creates:
- Database: `detection_to_direction`
- 6 tables
- 70 questions
- 12 therapists

### Step 3: Start Your App
```powershell
npm start
```

Open browser: **http://localhost:3000**

---

## ✅ Verify It Worked

In phpMyAdmin, run these queries:

```sql
USE detection_to_direction;

-- Check tables (should show 6)
SHOW TABLES;

-- Check questions (should be 70)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM questions;

-- Check therapists (should be 12)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM therapists;
```

Expected results:
- **6 tables**: users, children, questions, therapists, screenings, screening_answers
- **70 questions**: 20 ASD + 25 ADHD + 25 Dyslexia
- **12 therapists**: Various centers in KL/Selangor

## 🎯 What Changed?

**OLD WAY (3 files):**
1. sql/schema.sql
2. sql/seed_questions.sql ← This gave you the error
3. sql/seed_therapists.sql

**NEW WAY (1 file):**
✅ sql/COMPLETE_SETUP.sql ← Use this instead!

This file:
- Drops any existing tables first (fixes errors)
- Creates all tables fresh
- Inserts all data
- Works every time!

---

## 📝 Files You DON'T Need:

❌ `public/data/questions.json` - ignore it  
❌ `public/data/therapists.json` - ignore it  
❌ `public/i18n/en.json` - not used yet  

All data comes from MySQL database now!

## 🎉 Ready to Use!

After setup, you can:
1. ✅ Create account
2. ✅ Add children (they'll show in cards!)
3. ✅ Run screenings (children appear in dropdown!)
4. ✅ Search therapists
5. ✅ Get recommendations

Everything works with the beautiful new UI! 🎨
